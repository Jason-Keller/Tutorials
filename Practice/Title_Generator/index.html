            <p class="titleInflationDef">Title inflation is the not-so-subtle art of inflating titles without meaning -- and without a corresponding increase in pay.
                <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/06/looking-for-a-job-americas-listings-are-inscrutable/591616/">The Atlantic</a></em> brings up an important point: the call for "extremists" in otherwise menial roles. You want a customer service "rockstar"? Pay your "rockstar" like a rockstar, and you'll get a rockstar. What many recruiters, hiring managers and "HR prophets" often forget is that the person on the other end of the interview is human; we're prone to nervous smiles, trembling hands, fumbling words, and, let's face it, a lack of life-alterting passion for some roles. So no, we're not "horny for sales." We're not "dying" to get to fix your codebase. We want to work -- ideally at a job we're <em>actually</em> passionate about, earning enough to live comfortably if we so desire, and still have some semblance of a life outside of our careers as... "Software Rockstars.""
